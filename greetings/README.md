# Bzlmod + Golang Demo: Greetings

This is a very simple go module, it is designed to parallel [this tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module) for go modules, while using bazel/bzlmod.

The purpose is just to expose this module for use by the `hello` module/project.

There's nothing much else to cover here.
